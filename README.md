Pushes a Jekyll site to a remote server.  Works under the following assumptions:

	* It is executed from the root Jekyll directory, whose name is the same as the site url.

	* WEBSERVER and SITES are shell environmental variables, defining the server address (eg. username@example.com) and the directory on the server where sites live.
